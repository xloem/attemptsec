does this device have any identifying numbers in software or hardware?

	Current state:
	- not connecting to any external storage devices
	- not intentionally connecting to any networks
	- would be good to review system for communication avenues and disable them in software
			- for hardware, invest disabling energy in a differing system
	- communicating only via usb serial port using affixed cable.

	Device has an old operating system that has been networked.
	Image and device behaved reliably a few years ago.
	A few weeks ago, the device's baud began changing on its own at boot.
	I had not networked it, but I had connected a disk drive via SATA and used the serial port.
	I stopped using it.
